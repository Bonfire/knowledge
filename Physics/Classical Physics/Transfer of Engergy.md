# Transfer of Energy

## Notes
- Forms of Energy:
  - Kinetic - `K = (1/2)mvÂ²`, where `m` is mass, and `v` is velocity.
  - Potential - `U = mgh`, where `m` is mass, `g` is the gravitational constant, and `h` is height in meters.
  - Internal - Things such as heat.
- Types of Systems:
  - Isolated - No transfer of energy (total energy is constant)
  - Non-Isolated - Total energy changes (crosses out of the boundary of the system)
