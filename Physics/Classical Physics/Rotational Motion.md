# Rotational Motion

## Notes
- Rigid Body:
  - Non-deformable object
  - Location of the particles remain fixed
  - Motion is negative
- Parameters in Rotational Motion:
  - Angular Position (θ) - Angle made by an object in rotational motion for a given time interval. Measured in radians.
  - Angular Displacement - Change of Angular Position.
  - Angular Velocity (ω) - Rate of change of angular displacement.
  - Angular Acceleration (α) - Rate of change of angular velocity. Measure in `rads/s²`
- Moment of Inertia (I) - Like a mass in rotational motion, that has resistance with rotational force. Depends on masses, distribution of masse, and axis of rotation. Measured in `kgm²`.

## Equations
- Kinematic Relationships:
  - `θ = (s/r)`
  - `s = θr`
  - `v = rω`
  - `a = rα`
