# Momentum

## Notes
- Conservation of Linear Momentum - The total momentum (P) of a system remains constant. That is, `Pi = Pf`.
- Center of Mass (CM) - The point in an object where all of the mass is supposed to be concentrated. If an external force acts upon an object, it acts at the center of mass.
- Mass-Related Symbols:
  - λ - `mass/length`
  - σ - `mass/area`
  - ρ - `mass/volume`

## Equations
- Linear Momentum - `P = mv`, where `m` is mass and `v` is velocity.
- Force - `F = ma = (dP/dt)`, where `a` is acceleration.
- Impulse - `Pf - Pi` where `Pf` is final momentum and `Pi` is initial momentum.
- Kinetic Energy Relationship - `KE = (P²/(2m))`
