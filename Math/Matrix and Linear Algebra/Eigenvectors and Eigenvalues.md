# Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

## Notes
- Eigenvalue - A scalar, *λ*, is called an **eigenvalue** of an `n x n` matrix *A* if there exists a nontrivial solution, **x**, for *A*__x__ = λ**x**, where **x** is an *eigenvector* corresponding to λ.
- Eigenvector - An eigenvector of an `n x n` matrix *A* is a non-zero vector **x** such that *A*__x__ = λ**x** for some eigenvalue (scalar) *λ*.
