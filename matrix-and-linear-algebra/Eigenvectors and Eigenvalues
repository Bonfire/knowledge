## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

* Eigenvector - An eigenvector of an *n x n* matrix *b* is a nonzero vector
**x** such that *A* **x** = λ**x** from some scalar λ.
* Eigenvalue - A scalar λ is called an **eigenvalue** of *A* if there is a
nontrivial solution **x** of *A* **x** = λ**x**; such an **x** is called
an *eigenvector corresponding to λ*.
