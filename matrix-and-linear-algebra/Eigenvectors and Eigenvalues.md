## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

* Eigenvector - An eigenvector of an *n x n* matrix *b* is a nonzero vector **x** such that *A* **x** = $\lambda$**x** from some scalar $\lambda$.
* Eigenvalue - A scalar $\lambda$ is called an **eigenvalue** of *A* if there is a nontrivial solution **x** of *A* **x** = $\lambda$**x**; such an **x** is called an *eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda$*.
