## Chapter 8 - Transfer of Energy

Forms of Energy:
* Kinetic:
  * $k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$
  * Due to motion
* Potential:
  * $u = mgh$
* Internal:
  * Heat

Types of Systems:
* Isolated - No transfer of energy (total energy is constant)
* Non-isolated - Total energy changes (crosses out of the boundary of the system)

**Example**: What average power is generated by a 70.0-kg mountain climber who climbs a summit of height 325 m in 95.0 min?
* The force of the climber can be calculated by $F = mg$, in our case $F = 70.0 * 9.8 = 686 N$
* Work done is $W = F * d$ where $F = 686 N$ and $d = 325m$, so $F = 686 * 325 J = 222.96 kJ$
* Average power is $\frac{W}{t} = \frac{222.96}{95 * 60} = 39.1 W$
