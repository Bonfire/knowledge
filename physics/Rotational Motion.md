## Chapter 10 - Rotational Motion

Rigid Body:
* Non-deformable object
* Location of the particles remain fixed
* Motion is negative

Parameters in Rotational Motion:
* Angular Position ($\theta$):
  * Angle made by an object in rotational motion for a given time interval
  * Measured in radians (1rad × 180/$\pi$)
* Angular Displacement:
  * $\theta = \theta_{2} - \theta_{1}$
* Angular Velocity ($\omega$):
  * Rate of change of angular displacement
  * Average $-$ $\omega = \frac{\theta_{2} - \theta_{1}}{t_{2} - t_{1}} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$
* Angular Acceleration ($\alpha$):
  * Rate of change of angular velocity
  * Average $-$ $\alpha = \frac{\omega_{2} - \omega_{1}}{t_{2} - t_{1}} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$
  * Measured in $\frac{rad}{s^{2}}$

Kinematic Relationships:
* $\theta = \frac{s}{r}$
* $s = \theta r$
* $v = r \omega$
* $a = r \alpha$

Rotational Formulas:
* $\omega_{f} = \omega_{i} + \alpha t$
* $\theta - \omega_{i}t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^{2}$
* $\omega_{f}^{2} = \omega_{i}^{2} + 2\alpha\theta$

Rotational Kinetic Energy:
* $K = \frac{1}{2} (\sum_{i}m_{i}r_{i}^2)$
* $K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$; where $I = \sum_{i}m_{i}r_{i}^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

Moment of Inertia (I):
* $I = \sum_{i}m_{i}r_{i}^2$
* Like a mass in rotational motion
* Resistance with rotational force
* Measured in $kgm^{2}$
* Depends on:
  * Masses
  * Distribution of masses
  * Axis of rotation

**Examples**

* A rigid object rotates in a counterclockwise sense around a fixed axis. Each of the following pairs of quantities represents an initial angular position and a final angular position of the rigid object. Which of the sets can only occur if the rigid object rotates through more than 180°?
  * 1 rad, 5 rad
  * 5 rad - 1 rad = 4 rad > 180 degrees
* A rigid object rotates in a counterclockwise sense around a fixed axis. Each of the following pairs of quantities represents an initial angular position and a final angular position of the rigid object. Suppose the change in angular position for each of these pairs of values occurs in 1 s. Which choice represents the lowest average angular speed?
  * -1 rad, 1 rad
  * 1 rad - (-1 rad) = 2 rad $\approx$ 114.5 degrees
* Ethan and Joseph are riding on a merry-go-round. Ethan rides on a horse at the outer rim of the circular platform, twice as far from the center of the circular platform as Joseph, who rides on an inner horse. When the merry-go-round is rotating at a constant angular speed, what is Ethan’s angular speed?
  * The same as Joseph’s
  * The system of the platform, Ethan, and Joseph is a rigid object, so all points on the rigid object have the same angular speed.
* Ethan and Joseph are riding on a merry-go-round. Ethan rides on a horse at the outer rim of the circular platform, twice as far from the center of the circular platform as Joseph, who rides on an inner horse.  When the merry-go-round is rotating at a constant angular speed, what is Ethan’s tangential speed?
  * Twice Joseph's
  * The tangential speed is proportional to the radial distance from the rotation axis.
* A section of hollow pipe and a solid cylinder have the same radius, mass, and length. They both rotate about their long central axes with the same angular speed. Which object has the higher rotational kinetic energy?
  * The hollow pipe
  * Almost all the mass of the pipe is at the same distance from the rotation axis, so it has a larger moment of inertia than the solid cylinder.
* A ball rolls without slipping down incline A, starting from rest. At the same time, a box starts from rest and slides down incline B, which is identical to incline A except that it is frictionless. Which arrives at the bottom first?
  * For the ball, some of the gravitational potential energy of the ball–Earth system is transformed to rotational kinetic energy, leaving less for translational kinetic energy, so the ball moves downhill more slowly than the box does.
* A grindstone increases in angular speed from 4.00 rad/s to 12.00 rad/s in 4.00 s. Through what angle does it turn during that time interval if the angular acceleration is constant?
  * 32 rad
  * $\Delta q = \omega\alpha v * \Delta t = \frac{Δt(ω_{f} + ω_{i})}{2} = \frac{(4.00 s)(12.00 rad/s + 4.00 rad/s)}{2} = 32$ rad
* A cyclist rides a bicycle with a wheel radius of 0.500 m across campus. A piece of plastic on the front rim makes a clicking sound every time it passes through the fork. If the cyclist counts 320 clicks between her apartment and the cafeteria, how far has she traveled?
  * 1.0 km
  * The wheel has a radius of 0.500 m and made 320 revolutions. The distance traveled is $s = r\theta = (0.500 m)(320 rev)(\frac{2π rad}{1 rev}) = 1.00 × 103 m = 1.00 km$
* Suppose a car’s standard tires are replaced with tires 1.30 times larger in diameter. Will the car’s speedometer reading be
  * 1.3x too low
  * The speedometer measures the number of revolutions per second of the tires. A larger tire will travel more distance in one full revolution as $2\pi r$.
