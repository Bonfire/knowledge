# Diffusion

## Notes
- Transmission Rate - How likely a node is to spread a "disease" (usually given as a percentage).
- SIR Network Model - The Susceptible-Infected-Removed network model is a model that tells the three different states a node can be in. Nodes start out as susceptible, can be infected, and become removed (meaning they can no longer be infected or infect others).
- SIS Network Model - The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible network model is a model that allows nodes to be susceptible, get infected, lose the infection, then be susceptible again. Due to the nature of nodes within the SIS-model, an infection can last a long time within a network.
- Critical Threshold - The point (the transmission rate as a percentage) in an SIS-network where the infection lasts for extended periods of time and "lingers" within the network.
- SISa Network Model - The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible-Automatic network model is the same as a SIS network model, however, in the SISa, there also exist spontaneous activations within the network. As in, random nodes may acquire the infection by chance and proceed to spread them.
- Degree - The degree of a node is the number of neighbors it has.
