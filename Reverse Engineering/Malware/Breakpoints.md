# Breakpoints

## Notes
- Common Windows API breakpoints for malware:
  - `VirtualAlloc` in `kernelbase.dll` whose return value is the address of newly allocated memory and the return value is placed in register `eax`.
  - `VirtualProtect` in `kernelbase.dll` which is used by a process to write to itself when performing Self-Injection. This changes the protections which grants the malware the permissions to write.
